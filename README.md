TP de C++ pour Sup Galil√©e\
Some C++ coding exercise I had to do for school. I've mostly used English in this repo, but you might
find some stuff in French too. Haven't really set a rule for myself, here.

Just realized the instructions indicated the use of C++17, but I'm using `std::format` in my code, which
is C++20. The instructions say that so that you have to use `unordered_map`'s `find()` method rather
than `contains()`. I've decided to follow the latter, but I'm to keep `std::format` nonetheless.
