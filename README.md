TP de C++ pour Sup Galil√©e\
Some C++ coding exercise I had to do for school, and which I'm re-doing from scratch.
I've mostly used English in this repo, but you might
find some stuff in French too. Haven't really set a rule for myself here.

Just realized the instructions indicated the use of C++17, but I'm using `std::format` in my code, which
is C++20. The instructions say that so that you have to use `unordered_map`'s `find()` method rather
than `contains()`. I've decided to follow the latter, but I'm maintaining the use of `std::format` nonetheless.

Realized/remembered the instructions for this had some mistakes in, which confused me for a bit.\
\+ It feels like the whole thing is a little obfuscated on purpose, which makes sense for a teacher
wanting to evaluate their students' abilities, but also a little frustrating, especially in combination
with the mistakes that find their way into the given instructions every now and then.
